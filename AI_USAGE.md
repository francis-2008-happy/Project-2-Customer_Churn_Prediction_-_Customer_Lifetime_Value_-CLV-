This project was developed with assistance from **AI tools (ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot)**.  

### Where AI was used:
1. **Code generation & debugging**:
   - Streamlit layout (tabs, forms, charts).
   - Error handling with encoders and SHAP.
   - Plotly visualizations in Tab 2 & Tab 3.
   - Explanations of errors (`KeyError`, `ValueError`, `SyntaxError`).
   - Guidance on SHAP integration and preprocessing alignment.

### What was **not** AI-generated:
- Core data preprocessing logic.
- Model training (done in Jupyter notebooks).
- Final decision-making on features, structure, and evaluation.

### Verification:
All AI-generated code and text were reviewed, tested, and adapted by me before inclusion.
